# Project Title

FullStack JS with Node and Express(Basic CRUD APP using The Cat API)

## Introduction

This project is part of my journey through learning web development, specifically focusing on Node.js and Express. Throughout this assignment, I encountered a range of challenges that tested my understanding and problem-solving skills in web development.

The final outcome of the front end is not the pretiest but it serves its purpose. I need to work a little bit more on my front end coding skills. 
## Challenges Faced
The first time I looked over the assignment i though i would not be able to finish it but after countless hours of research i gained enough knowledge to understand how the structure worked and was able to complete it.

Throughout this assignment, I faced several challenges that required me to think critically and seek external resources for solutions. Some of the main hurdles included:

- Understanding the asynchronous nature of Node.js and how to effectively use promises and async/await syntax.
- Configuring Express routes to serve dynamic content using EJS templates.
- Implementing CRUD operations and ensuring data persistence by reading from and writing to a local JSON file.
- Debugging error messages that were often cryptic or unfamiliar to me as a beginner.

## Resources Used

To overcome the obstacles mentioned above, I utilized a combination of educational content and interactive assistance:

- **The Complete 2024 Web Developer Bootcamp by Angela Yu**: This comprehensive course provided me with a solid foundation in web development principles and hands-on experience with Node.js and Express. Angela's teaching style made complex concepts more approachable and easier to understand.

- **ChatGPT**: Whenever I encountered error messages or needed clarification on specific topics, ChatGPT was an invaluable resource. It helped me understand the errors I was facing and guided me towards finding effective solutions.

- **Official Documentation**: For both Node.js and Express, the official documentation was a crucial reference that helped me understand best practices and the functionalities available to me.

## Key Learnings

This assignment was a significant learning opportunity that helped me:

- Gain practical experience with server-side programming using Node.js and Express.
- Understand the importance of reading and interpreting error messages for debugging.
- Appreciate the value of external resources, including educational courses and AI-powered assistance, in accelerating my learning process.

## Acknowledgments

- Angela Yu, for creating an engaging and informative course that has been instrumental in my web development journey.
- OpenAI's ChatGPT, for providing instant, interactive help whenever I was stuck.

## Conclusion

This project not only challenged my problem-solving skills but also highlighted the importance of perseverance and utilizing a variety of learning resources. It was a reminder that in the field of web development, challenges are opportunities for growth, and no resource is too small to make a significant impact on oneâ€™s learning journey.
